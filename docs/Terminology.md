# Terminology

On this page you can quickly get a grasp of common UiTPAS terminology and concepts, referenced throughout the API documentation.

## Passholder

One who holds an UiTPAS, the end-user of an UiTPAS.

## Structural discount ('kansentariefâ€™)

Passholders in need can receive a structural discount ('kansentarief') on their UiTPAS. 
This structural discount is given by the local government based on local poverty parameters. 

Those discounts are payed via a third-party payer system in which the organizer of the event, the local government and the passholder each pay a percentage of the ticket price. Payments are organized via a manual financial reporting flow within UiTPAS.

## Coupon

An UiTPAS-coupon is a discount that is made available to a subset of passholders.
Based on certain parameters such as the residence of the passholder, this coupon is automatically made available to the passholder.

For example: the City of Hasselt awards a 5 euro discount to all passholders of Hasselt.
This discount will automatically be made available to all inhabitants of Hasselt.
When the UiTPAS-price for an inabitant of Hasselt is checked, this coupon will show up as an option and can then be redeemed.
