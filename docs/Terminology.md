# Terminology

On this page you can quickly get a grasp of common UiTPAS terminology and concepts, referenced throughout the API documentation.

## Passholder

One who holds an UiTPAS, the end-user of an UiTPAS.

## Structural discount ('kansentariefâ€™)

Passholders in need can receive a structural discount ('kansentarief') on their UiTPAS. 
This structural discount is given by the local government based on local poverty parameters. 

Those discounts are payed via a third-party payer system in which the organizer of the event, the local government and the passholder each pay a percentage of the ticket price. Payments are organized via a manual financial reporting flow within UiTPAS.
