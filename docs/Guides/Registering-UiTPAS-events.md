# Registering UiTPAS events

This guide will explain how to register an event as an UiTPAS event.

## Importing the event in UiTDatabank

Every UiTPAS event needs to be registered in UiTDatabank first. Aside from the required properties to create a new event in UiTDatabank, UiTPAS events in UiTDatabank require the `priceInfo` property with at least a `base` price that's **not** free (`EUR 0`), as well as a linked `organizer` from a list of known UiTPAS organizers.
