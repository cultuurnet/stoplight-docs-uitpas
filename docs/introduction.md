# Introduction

A warm welcome to our UiTPAS API documentation! ðŸ‘‹

Check out our [development quick start guide](https://publiq.stoplight.io/docs/uitpas/docs/Quickstart.md) to get up and running.

The UiTPAS API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

In this documentation you'll find:

- Code examples so you can see see how it works in practice.
- Step-by-step guides to common UiTPAS integration scenarios.
- Explanations of relevant UiTPAS concepts.

## What is UiTPAS?
UiTPAS is a loyalty card for cultural, sports, and leisure events in Flanders and Brussels. More than 250.000 passholders can save points by attending events and trade them for rewards.

Next to rewards, passholders in need can receive a social tariff ('kansentarief') on UiTPAS events. Those discounts are payed for via a third-party payer system in which the organizer of the event, the local government and the passholder each pay a percentage of the ticket price.
