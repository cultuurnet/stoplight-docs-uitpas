# Terminology

On this page you can quickly get a grasp of common UiTPAS terminology and concepts, referenced throughout the API documentation.

## Passholder

One who holds an UiTPAS, the end-user of an UiTPAS.

## UiTPAS Organizer

The organizer of an UiTPAS event. To pay for the social tariff for people in need, the organizer is partly reimbursed by the local government. That's why it's important to always create UiTPAS events with the correct UiTPAS organizer.

## Social Tariff ('kansentarief')

Passholders in need can receive a social tariff ('kansentarief') on their UiTPAS. 
This social tariff is given by the local government based on local poverty parameters. 

Those discounts are paid via a third-party payer system in which the organizer of the event, the local government and the passholder each pay a percentage of the ticket price. Payments are organized via a manual financial reporting flow within UiTPAS.

## Coupon

An UiTPAS coupon is a discount that is made available to a subset of passholders.
Based on certain parameters such as the residence of the passholder, this coupon is automatically made available to the passholder.

For example: the City of Hasselt awards a 5 euro coupon to all passholders of Hasselt.
This coupon will automatically be made available to all inhabitants of Hasselt.
When the UiTPAS tariff for an inhabitant of Hasselt is checked, this coupon will show up as an option and can then be redeemed.

## Check-in

When a passholder saves an UiTPAS point, we call this a check-in.
An UiTPAS point is earned for participating in a specific event, mostly by holding the card to a check-in device located at the organizer of the event.

## Rewards 

After saving UiTPAS points, a passholder can trade them for fun [rewards](https://www.uitpas.be/voordelen-zoeken#/voordelen) provided by local UiTPAS organizers. 

Some rewards can only be traded at the event of the organizer (material rewards like a goodie bag). Other rewards can also be traded online via [UiTPAS.be](http://uitpas.be) (digital rewards such as an e-ticket).
